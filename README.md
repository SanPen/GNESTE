# GNESTE: The Global and National Energy Systems Techno-Economic Database

The goal of GNESTE is to develop a comprehensive database of cost and performance data for key electricity generation and storage technologies:	
* Coal Power
* Gas Power
* Hydro Power
* Nuclear Power
* Solar Power
* Wind Power
* Battery Energy Storage Systems

Data are collected on:	
* Capital Cost
* Fixed O&M Cost
* Variable O&M Cost
* Total O&M Cost
* Fuel Price
* Efficiency
* Construction Time
* Operating Lifetime
* Cost of Capital
	
The GNESTE database is documented in a paper submitted to the [Data in Brief journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief).  Once published, please consult the article which details the process for collecting data, defines all variables and categories of data, and gives examples of its usage. 

The files presented here are in machine-readable CSV format.  The same data are also made available in Excel format, with additional metadata and documentation, from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11065567).

## Citation

Once the Data in Brief article is published, please cite that article if you use this data - rather than citing this GitHub repository.
